<p><strong>&quot;A&quot;</strong> is for <strong>AVAILABLE</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent-40">Forgiveness is <strong>available for all</strong>...</p>
<p class="indent-40"><em>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</em>

<a id="available">(John 3:16)</a></p>

<p class="indent-40"><em>Not everyone who says to Me, &quot;Lord, Lord,&quot; shall enter the kingdom of heaven.</em>&nbsp;

<p><strong>&quot;I&quot;</strong> is for <strong>IMPOSSIBLE</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent-40">It is impossible for God to allow sin into heaven.</p>
<ul>
    <li>God is <strong>love.</strong>&nbsp;
<p class="indent-40"><em>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</em> 
<br/>    
<a id="godsLove">(John 3:16)</a></li>
    <li>God is <strong>just.</strong>&nbsp;
<p class="indent-40"><em>&quot;For judgment is without mercy.&quot;</em>&nbsp;
<br/>
<a id="godsMercy">(James 2:13)</a></p></li>
    <li>Man is <strong>sinful.</strong>
<p class="indent-40"><em>&quot;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&quot;</em>&nbsp;
<br/>
<a id="manIsSinful">(Romans 3:22-26)</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent-40"><strong>Question:</strong> But how can a sinful person enter heaven, where God allows no sin?</p>
<p><strong>&quot;T&quot;</strong> is for <strong>TURN</strong>.</p>
<!--    
<p class="indent-40"><strong>Question:</strong> If you were driving down the road and someone asked you to turn, what would s/he be asking you do to? <em>To change direction.</em></p>
-->
<p class="indent-40">To <strong>turn</strong> means <strong>to repent.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TURN</strong> <strong>from something</strong>&mdash;from sin and self.
<p class="indent-40"><em>&quot;But unless you repent you will all likewise perish.&quot;</em>&nbsp;
<br/>
<a id="turnFromSin">(Luke 13:1-3)</a></p></li>
    <li><strong>TURN</strong> <strong>to Someone</strong>&mdash;trust Christ only. The Bible tells us that&nbsp;
<p class="indent-40"><em>&quot;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.&quot;</em>&nbsp;
<br/>
<a id='christDied'>(1 Corinthians 15:3&ndash;4)</a></p>
<p class="indent-40"><em>&quot;If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&quot;</em>&nbsp; 
<br/>
<a id='believeChristDiedForUs'>(Romans 10:9-10)</a></p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>&quot;H&quot;</strong> is for <strong>HEAVEN</strong></p>
<p class="indent-40">Heaven is <strong>eternal life</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Here.</strong>
<p class="indent-40"><em>&quot;I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.&quot;</em>&nbsp;

    <li><strong>Hereafter.</strong>
<p class="indent-40"><em>&quot;And if I&nbsp;go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I&nbsp;am, there you may be also.&quot;</em>&nbsp;
<br/>    
<a id='hereAfter'>(John 14:3)</a></p></li>
    <li><strong>How?</strong>
<p class="indent-40"><em>If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</em>
